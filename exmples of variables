Variables are fundamental building blocks in programming.
A variable acts as a container for storing data values.
They allow developers to label and manage data in their code.
Think of a variable as a named memory location.
This memory location holds the data assigned to the variable.
Variables are used to store, retrieve, and manipulate information.
They make programs flexible by allowing dynamic changes in data.
