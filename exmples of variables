Integer: Stores whole numbers without any decimal points.
Example: age = 25

Float: Stores numbers with decimal points.
Example: price = 10.99

String: Stores text or characters.
Example: name = "John"

Boolean: Stores True or False values.
Example: is_student = True

List: Stores a collection of items in a specific order.
Example: numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]

Tuple: Similar to a list, but immutable (cannot be changed).
Example: coordinates = (10, 20)

Dictionary: Stores key-value pairs.
Example: person = {"name": "Alice", "age": 30}

Set: Stores a collection of unique items (no duplicates).
Example: unique_numbers = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}

In C++, variables are used to store data of different types, such as integers, floating-point numbers, characters, and more. Here are some commonly used types of variables in C++:

Integer Variables:

int: Used to store integer values.
short: Used to store smaller integer values than int.
long: Used to store larger integer values than int.
long long: Used to store very large integer values.
unsigned int, unsigned short, unsigned long, unsigned long long: Used to store only non-negative integer values.
Floating-Point Variables:

float: Used to store single-precision floating-point numbers.
double: Used to store double-precision floating-point numbers.
long double: Used to store extended-precision floating-point numbers.
Character Variables:

char: Used to store single characters.
wchar_t: Used to store wide characters (larger character set than char).
char16_t, char32_t: Used to store UTF-16 and UTF-32 characters, respectively.
Boolean Variable:

bool: Used to store boolean values (true or false).
Pointers:

Pointers are variables that store memory addresses.
They are used to work with dynamic memory allocation and to manipulate memory directly.
Pointer types are derived from other types by appending *

Tuple: Similar to a list, but immutable (cannot be changed).
Example: coordinates = (10, 20)

age = 25
count = 10

char: Used to store single characters.
wchar_t: Used to store wide characters (larger character set than char).
char16_t, char32_t: Used to store UTF-16 and UTF-32 characters, respectively.
Boolean Variable:

Tuple: Similar to a list, but immutable (cannot be changed).
Example: coordinates = (10, 20)

Integer: Stores whole numbers without any decimal points.
Example: age = 25
